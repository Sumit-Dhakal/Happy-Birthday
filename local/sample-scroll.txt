My dearest Surakshya 💖,

Today is not just another day—it’s YOUR day. A day that the universe marked as special the moment you came into this world. 🌎✨

From the first smile you shared to every memory we’ve created together, you’ve been a source of warmth, laughter, and inspiration. Your kindness, your strength, and the way you light up every room… it’s magic. ✨

I want you to know how deeply you are loved—not just today, but every single day. 💕 This year, may you discover new adventures, find greater happiness, and keep shining brighter than ever.

No words can truly capture how much you mean to me. But if I had to say it in one line: you are infinity ♾️ to me.

So here’s to you, Suru 🥂—to your smile, your dreams, and the beautiful journey ahead.  
Happy Birthday, my star 🌟

Forever yours,  
💌
